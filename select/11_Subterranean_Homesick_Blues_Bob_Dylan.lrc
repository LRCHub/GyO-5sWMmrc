[00:09.08] Johnny's in the basement mixin' up the medicine
[00:11.44] I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
[00:14.17] The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
[00:16.86] Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
[00:42.36] 
[00:19.80] Look out, kid, it's somethin' you did
[00:22.32] God knows when, but you're doin' it again
[00:25.17] You better duck down the alleyway, lookin' for a new friend
[00:27.98] The man in the coon-skin cap in the big pen
[00:30.46] Wants 11 dollar bills, you only got ten
[00:49.96] 
[00:39.17] Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
[00:41.61] Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed book
[00:44.48] The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says, "The man, he say
[00:47.34] They must bust in early May, orders from the D.A."
[01:12.34] 
[00:50.31] Look out, kid, don't matter what you did
[00:52.77] Walk on your tip toes, don't tie no bows
[00:55.26] Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
[00:58.03] Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
[01:00.61] You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows
[01:30.61] 
[01:08.96] Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
[01:11.82] Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
[01:14.48] Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
[01:17.32] Get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail
[01:41.32] 
[01:20.16] Look out, kid, you're gonna get hit
[01:22.68] By losers, cheaters, six-time users
[01:25.80] Hangin' 'round the theaters
[01:26.97] Girl by the whirlpool's lookin' for a new fool
[01:29.80] Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
[01:52.80] 
[01:39.64] Ah, get born, keep warm, short pants, romance
[01:42.21] Learn to dance, get dressed, get blessed, try to be a success
[01:45.91] Please her, please him, buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift
[01:49.28] 20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
[02:16.78] 
[01:52.00] Look out, kid, they keep it all hid
[01:54.55] Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
[01:57.55] Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
[02:00.25] Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
[02:03.15] The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles
