Warlords of the underworld
We raise each glass in your praise tonight
And celebrate bad decisions made
Like batteries and escalades
Imbibe with me in this fantasy
Of consequential reality
Have you ever given up
Just to find it was your ticket out?

Picture perfect worlds in you
Revel until your face is blue
Suffocate till you cannot see
Faking this will always be
Jets attack you take a nap
Burning trees you drink a little sap
Calm your nerves you lick (?) some ass and tits
Bunnies die to make up cheap lipstick

I'm not gonna stay home tonight
I'm not gonna know wrong from right
I'm not gonna say no to life
I'm gonna fight

I'm not gonna stay home tonight
I'm not gonna be so uptight
I'm not gonna follow the light
I'm gonna fight
