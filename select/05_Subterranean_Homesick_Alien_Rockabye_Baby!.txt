The breath of the morning i keep
Forgetting the smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell
A thing you watch your feet for cracks
In the pavement up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back
Home of all these wierd creatures
Who lock up their spirits drill holes in
Themselves and live for their secrets
They're all uptight
I wish that they'd swoop down in a
Country lane late at night when i'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as i'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd
Never believe they'd think that i'd finally
Lost it completely i'd show them the
Stars and meaning of life they'd shut
Me away but i'd be alright i'm just uptight
