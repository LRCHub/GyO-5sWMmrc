[03:15.68] Hey
[03:17.48] Just one more
[03:19.29] And I'll walk away
[03:22.27] All the everything you want
[03:25.80] Turns to nothing today
[03:28.71] I forget how to move
[03:31.59] When my mouth is this dry
[03:34.95] And my eyes are bursting hearts
[03:38.24] In a blood-stained sky
[03:40.97] Yeah it was sweet
[03:42.94] It was wild
[03:44.33] And oh how we
[03:47.73] Trembled
[03:49.01] Stuck in honey
[03:50.45] Honey
[03:51.33] Cling to me
[03:53.52] Just one more
[03:56.60] Just one more go
[03:59.81] Inspire in me
[04:01.54] The desire in me
[04:03.61] To never go home
[04:31.27] Just one more
[04:33.43] And I'll walk away
[04:36.32] All the everything you want
[04:39.44] Turns to nothing today
[04:43.63] Just one more
[04:45.90] Just one more go
[04:49.27] Inspire in me
[04:50.74] The desire in me
[04:53.54] To never go home
[05:05.35] To never go home
